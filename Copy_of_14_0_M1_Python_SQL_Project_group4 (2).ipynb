    "**Suggested Steps in the Project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Read this notebook and understand each function. Comment the code appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Populate the list of schools with a wider variety of schools (how are you going to get the school ID?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a look at the obtained dataframes. What dimensions do you have? what keys do you have? how could the different dataframes be connected?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go back to the drawing board and try to create an entity relationship diagram for tables available\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you have the schemas you want, you will need to:\n",
    "  - create the suitable SQL queries to create the tables and populate them\n",
    "  - run these queries using the appropriate Python connectors\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Bonus: How will this datamodel be updated in the future? Please write auxiliary functions that test the database for data quality issues. For example: how could you make sure you only include the most recent comments when you re-run the script?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suggested Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5-6 minute presentation of data model created, decision process and business analysis proposed\n",
    "\n",
    "* exported .sql file with the final schema\n",
    "\n",
    "* Supporting python files used to generate all logic\n",
    "\n",
    "* High level documentation explaining tables designed and focusing on update methods\n",
